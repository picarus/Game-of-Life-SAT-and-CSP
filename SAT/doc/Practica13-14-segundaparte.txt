Addendum to the Project "Completion of Stable Patterns in Game of Life"

Author: Javier Larrosa


In the first part of the course we studied Propositional Logic technology to model and
solve combinatorial problems. In the project you had to implement some software to 
transform the "Completion of Stable Patterns in Game of Life" to CNF in dimacs format. The
objective was to solve the problem with a SAT-solver such as Minisat.

In the second part of the course we are studying Constraint Programming. The second part of 
the project consists on finding the "MOST DENSE completion of stable patterns in Game of Life".
We say that one pattern is denser than another if it has more living cells. 

You must implement a Gecode program that reads the same type of input files as in the first
part and completes them with the most dense completion such that it is stable.
